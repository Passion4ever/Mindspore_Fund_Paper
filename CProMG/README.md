# CProMG: Controllable Protein-Oriented Molecule Generation with Desired Binding Affinity and Drug-Like Properties

Deep learning-based molecule generation becomes a new paradigm of de novo molecule design since it enables fast and directional exploration in the vast chemical space. We elaborate a novel framework for controllable protein-oriented molecule generation. (mindspore)

<!-- Here is the overview of the CProMG framework. -->
