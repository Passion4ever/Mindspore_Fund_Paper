# CMMS-GCL: Cross-Modality Metabolic Stability Prediction with Graph Contrastive Learning

Metabolic stability plays a crucial role in the early stages of drug discovery and development. Accurately modeling and predicting
molecular metabolic stability has great potential for the efficient screening of drug candidates as well as the optimization of lead compounds. Considering wet-lab experiment is time-consuming, laborious, and expensive, in silico prediction of metabolic stability is an alternative choice. However, few computational methods have been developed to address this task. In addition, it remains a significant challenge to explain key functional groups determining metabolic stability.
